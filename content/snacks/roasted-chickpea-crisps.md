### Calories: 200
### Serves: 2

## Ingredients:

- 1 can (400g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. Pat the chickpeas dry with a clean towel; remove any loose skins.
3. Toss chickpeas with olive oil and spices until evenly coated.
4. Spread in a single layer on the baking sheet and roast for 30–35 minutes,
   shaking the pan every 10 minutes, until golden and crisp.
5. Cool slightly — they crisp further as they cool. Store in an airtight jar.

### Notes:

- For extra crunch, roast 5–10 minutes longer, watching closely so they don't burn.
- Swap spices for curry powder, za'atar, or chili-lime for variety.
