## Ingredients:

- 1 large bunch kale (curly or lacinato), ribs removed and torn into bite-sized pieces
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp finely grated Parmesan (omit or replace with nutritional yeast to make vegan)

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. Make sure kale is completely dry (use a salad spinner or pat with towels).
3. Toss kale with olive oil and salt, massaging the oil into the leaves.
4. Spread in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake 18–22 minutes, turning halfway,
   until edges are crisp but not browned.
5. Remove, sprinkle with lemon zest and Parmesan, and cool before serving.

## Tips:
- Lower oven temperature and bake longer for more even crisping if your oven runs hot.
- Store in a paper bag or loosely covered container to avoid trapped moisture.
