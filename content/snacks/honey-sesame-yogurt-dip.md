## Ingredients:
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tbsp tahini (optional, for depth)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- Pinch of salt
- Sesame seeds and chopped scallion for garnish

## Instructions:

1. Whisk yogurt, honey, sesame oil, tahini (if using), lemon juice, and salt until smooth.
2. Taste and adjust — add a touch more honey for sweetness or lemon for brightness.
3. Chill for 20–30 minutes to let flavors meld.
4. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallion. Serve with apple slices, pita chips, or cucumber.

### Notes:
- To make a thinner dressing, stir in 1–2 tbsp water or more lemon juice.
- Swap honey for maple syrup to make vegan (use dairy-free yogurt).
