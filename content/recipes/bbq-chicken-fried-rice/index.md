- 150 g frozen peas and carrots

- 5 g sesame oil (1 tsp)
- 15 g avocado or canola oil (1 tbsp)
- 1/4 tsp white pepper

## Option 1 — With Eggs:

## Option 2 — With Broth (No Egg):
200 g uncooked jasmine or basmati rice (about 1 cup dry)
480 ml chicken broth (gluten-free)
5 g butter (1 tsp, optional for richness)

### Steps:
1.	Prepare Rice
  - Egg Option: Cook rice in water as usual, chill at least 1 hour or overnight
  - Broth Option: Cook rice in chicken broth instead of water (200 g rice + 480 ml broth). Chill at least 1 hour or overnight.

2.	Marinate the Chicken: Mix BBQ sauce, honey, garlic, olive oil, smoked paprika, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Toss chicken to coat. Marinate 30 minutes (overnight best).

3.	Cook the Chicken: Heat skillet or grill pan on medium-high. Cook 5–6 minutes per side until charred and internal temp reaches 74°C / 165°F.

4.	Cheddar Finish: Sprinkle cheddar over hot chicken, cover pan for 1–2 minutes until melted. Remove from heat and rest.

5.	Fried Rice: Heat avocado oil in a wok or skillet over high. Add onion and scallion whites, stir-fry 1–2 minutes.
•	If Using Eggs: Push aromatics aside, scramble eggs until just set.
•	If Using Broth Rice: Skip eggs, add a touch of butter later for richness.
6.	Add peas and carrots. Stir-fry 2 minutes.
7.	Add chilled rice, breaking up clumps. Stir-fry until hot and lightly crisped.
8.	Season with tamari, sesame oil, white pepper. Toss well. Stir in scallion greens at the end. If using broth rice, finish with butter.

### Serve:
Divide fried rice into 4 containers. Slice cheesy BBQ chicken and place on top or beside rice.
