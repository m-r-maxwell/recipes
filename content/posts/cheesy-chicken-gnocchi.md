## 4 Servings

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 450 g chicken breast, diced
- 4 slices gluten-free bacon, chopped
- 500 g gluten-free gnocchi (2 packs, or close to this amount)
- 120 ml gluten-free chicken broth
- 120 ml milk (or unsweetened almond milk)
- 75 g shredded cheddar cheese
- 30 g cream cheese
- 2 tablespoons homemade basil pesto (see below)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley (optional garnish)

## Instructions:
Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove and set aside.
Add the diced chicken to the same skillet and cook in the bacon fat until golden and cooked through. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Push the chicken to one side of the skillet, then add olive oil and sauté the gnocchi for 2 to 3 minutes until lightly browned.
Pour in the chicken broth and milk, stirring to loosen any browned bits. Simmer for about 5 minutes to cook the gnocchi through.
Reduce the heat and stir in cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and pesto. Mix until smooth and creamy.
Return the bacon to the pan, stir everything together, and adjust seasoning.
Top with parsley if using, then divide into 4 containers for meal prep.

## Homemade Basil Pesto (Makes about 120 ml / ½ cup)
- 40g fresh basil leaves (about 2 packed cups)
- 30g grated Parmesan (or 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast for dairy-free)
- 30g pine nuts (or walnuts)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 120 ml olive oil
- Juice of ½ lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
Toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, then allow to cool.
Add basil, nuts, Parmesan, and garlic to a food processor and pulse a few times.
With the motor running, slowly drizzle in olive oil until the pesto reaches your preferred texture.
Stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Store leftovers in the fridge with a layer of olive oil on top, or freeze in small portions.
