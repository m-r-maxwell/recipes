# Ingredients:
- 1 cup rice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup corn kernels
- Black pepper to taste
- 1/2 lb steak, thinly sliced (I used sirloin but flank or ribeye is great too!)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Sliced green onions for garnishing

# Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, oyster sauce, and soy sauce. Mix well. Add the thinly sliced steak to the bowl, ensuring all pieces are well-coated with the marinade. Allow the steak to marinate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Wash your rice thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear. Strain the rice to remove excess water.
3. Place the washed rice in a rice cooker and add the same quantity of water as you normally would for cooking rice. Sprinkle the corn kernels evenly on top of the rice and water. Season with black pepper to taste.
4. Start the rice cooker. For me, I press the “Plain” button.
5. Once the rice is cooked, quickly open the rice cooker lid and place the marinated steak slices on top of the hot rice. Immediately close the lid to retain the steam.
6. Let the steak cook for 2-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices and your preferred level of doneness. For me, 3 minutes works perfectly.

# Serve:
Open the lid, and serve the rice and steak mixture. Top each serving with 1/2 tablespoon of butter and garnish with green onions.
